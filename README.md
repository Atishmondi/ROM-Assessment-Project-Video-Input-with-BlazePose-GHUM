# ROM-Assessment-Project-Video-Input-with-BlazePose-GHUM
A Python-based system to analyze Range of Motion (ROM) of the right elbow joint from pre-recorded video input, using MediaPipe BlazePose GHUM for 3D landmark tracking.

📂 Project Overview
This project uses MediaPipe’s BlazePose GHUM model to track 3D joint landmarks from a video file, calculates elbow angles frame-by-frame, and overlays the data on an annotated output video. The system logs angle data and prints debug information for verification.

⚙️ Features
✅ Load video file input (e.g., .mp4)
✅ Extract 3D landmarks per frame
✅ Calculate right elbow angle
✅ Print debug info for verification
✅ Annotate video with landmarks and angle values
✅ Save annotated output video
✅ Display max and min angle observed in the session
